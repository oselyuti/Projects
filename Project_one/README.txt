The program contains four functions that select students based on their grades. Each function has a different criterion for evaluating and selecting best-performing students. 
The program also uses a .csv data file ('applicants.csv') filled with student grades as a basis for such analysis and outputs the final selection into a file called "results.csv". The file can be opened with Excel.

Instructions for running the code locally:
Visual Studio Code was used when developing and testing this program. Python 3.9.6. 
The program requires the input file to be named "applicants.csv" and will produce a .csv file called results with the line numbers of applicants matching the decision to accept or reject.
Make sure the input file is located in the same directory as the program itself. The output file will be placed in the current directory.
Python will have to be installed in order for the execution of this program to happen. Go to https://www.python.org/ to download it.
The program main.py then can be opened in Python IDLE. Clicking on run module or F5 will run the program and generate the new output file
named "results.csv".

Ethical Statement: This software should be permissible for real-world use because it uses verifiable data to make an objective decision with regard to the applicants for the job. 
Certainly, it is not in the best interest of the recruiters to use this software without adding other important factors  to their consideration; the type of institution attended, the age of the applicants, and many other factors may be important but are difficult to be expressed on a simple grade scale. 
This particular selection of candidates will select the very best academic performers, leaving many high-performing individuals out of the final list. 
Use of this software should be limited to candidate selection based on minimum academic qualifications required for the position and is not as effective when the choice to be made is between several high-performers due to very specific (not general enough) nature of this analytic algorithm.
